British Library
Received three collections: “Tim Cook”, “Keith Summers”, “Asian Instruments”;
Some issues were found in the data within dc:subject fields:
The original shelfmarks were being placed within dc:subject fields: e.g. "1CDR0010645 (copy of C1002/78)"
Compound subjects separated typically with comma or slash: “accordion, singer, male”, “concetina, singer, male”, “melodeon / stepdancing”
Some dangling characters were found: e.g. "violin)", "mandolin)", "accordion [?]"
For the asian instruments collection, found some strange characters in subjects like “ba~sri" and "ba~suri” that look related to encoding, and found " and" in the subject field of two records which looks coming from some splitting logic or just typo.
